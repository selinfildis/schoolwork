## Project Description
We are planning on developing a classic **tower defense game** with some *surprise Bilkent-related contents.* A tower defense game is basically defending a tower from invaders. There will be *waves* of invaders. Wave by wave, the invaders will get more and more advanced and the player should build better defensive structures such as turrets, shields and so on. To build better defense, player will need resources and these resources will be collected by eliminating the invaders. If player fails to eliminate every invader, in other words, if some of the invaders make it to the tower, the tower will take damage according to the number of invaders reached. If tower takes too much damage, it will be destroyed and game will be over hence the player is defeated. On the other hand if the tower survives all of the waves, this means a victory for the player.
In our game, the towers will be among the buildings inside the Bilkent University Campus and the invaders will be some familiar faces around. Power-ups, turrets, shields will all be related to things in our school, Bilkent.
